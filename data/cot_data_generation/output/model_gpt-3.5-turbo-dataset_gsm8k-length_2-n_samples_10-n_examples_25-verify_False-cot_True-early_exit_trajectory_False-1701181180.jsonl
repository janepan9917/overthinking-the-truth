Since there are 5 days, her total earnings are:\n\nTotal earnings = (Regular daily earnings + Overtime earnings) \u00d7 number of days\nTotal earnings = ($144.00/day + $54.00/day) \u00d7 5 days\nTotal earnings = $198.00/day \u00d7 5 days = $990.00\n\nAnswer: Tina makes $990.00 in total for working 10 hours every day for 5 days.", "Step 1: Calculate Tina's regular pay for 8 hours of work per day.\nTina makes $18.00 per hour.\nSo her regular pay for 8 hours of work per day would be: $18.00/hour * 8 hours/day = $<<18*8=144.00>>144.00/day\n\nStep 2: Calculate Tina's overtime pay for the 2 extra hours of work each day.\nOvertime pay is calculated by adding 1/2 of Tina's hourly wage to her regular hourly wage.\nTherefore, 1/2 * $18.00/hour = $9.00/hour\nSo the overtime pay rate would be $18.00/hour + $9.00/hour = $27.00/hour\n\nTina worked 2 extra hours per day for 5 days, so her total overtime hours would be 2 hours/day * 5 days = 10 hours.\n\nTherefore, Tina's overtime pay for the week would be: $27.00/hour * 10 hours = $<<27*10=270.00>>270.00\n\nStep 3: Calculate Tina's total pay for the week.\nTina's regular pay for 5 days would be: $144.00/day * 5 days = $<<144*5=720.00>>720.00\nTina's overtime pay for the week is: $270.00\n\nTherefore, Tina's total pay for the week would be: $720.00 + $270.00 = $<<720+270=990.00>>990.00\n\nAnswer: Tina would make $990.00 for working 10 hours every day for 5 days.", "1. Calculate Tina's regular earnings for each day:\nTina earns $18.00 per hour\nShe works 10 hours per day for 5 days\nTotal regular hours worked = 10 hours/day * 5 days = 50 hours\nRegular earnings = $18.00/hour * 50 hours = $900.00\n\n2. Calculate the number of overtime hours:\nTina works more than 8 hours per shift, so any hours worked beyond 8 hours count as overtime.\nOvertime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours worked = 10 hours/day - 8 hours/day = 2 hours/day\nTotal overtime hours for 5 days = 2 hours/day * 5 days = 10 hours\n\n3. Calculate Tina's overtime earnings:\nOvertime pay rate = Hourly wage + 1/2 of the hourly wage\nOvertime pay rate = $18.00/hour + 1/2 * $18.00/hour = $18.00/hour + $9.00/hour = $27.00/hour\nOvertime earnings = Overtime pay rate * Overtime hours = $27.00/hour * 10 hours = $270.00\n\n4. Calculate Tina's total earnings:\nTotal earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings\nTotal earnings = $900.00 + $270.00 = $1170.00\n\nAnswer: Tina makes $1170.00."]}

We know that over three hundred years, the monster has consumed 847 people. Therefore, we can start by dividing 847 by 3 to find the average number of people the monster consumes each century. \n\n847 / 3 = 282.33\n\n2. Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we need to round this number up to the nearest whole number. \n\nRound up 282.33 to the nearest whole number = 283\n\n3.

Let's assume that the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years is \"x\".\n\n3. In the second hundred years, the ship would have twice as many people, so there would be 2x people on the ship.\n\n4. In the third hundred years, the ship would have twice as many people as in the second hundred years, so there would be 2(2x) = 4x people on the ship.\n\n5. Adding up the number of people on the ship in each hundred-year period, we have x + 2x + 4x = 7x people in total.\n\n6. Since on average, the monster consumes 282.33 people in each hundred-year period, we can set up the equation 7x = 282.33.\n\n7.

We know that the monster rises once every hundred years and has consumed 847 people over three hundred years.\n2. This means that the monster has consumed an average of 847/3 = 282 people per hundred years.\n3. Assuming the number of people on each ship follows a pattern where each new ship has twice as many people as the previous ship, we need to find the initial number of people on the first ship.\n4. Let's assume the number of people on the first ship is x.\n5. The number of people on the second ship would be 2x, the third ship would have 4x, and so on.\n6.

We know that the total number of people consumed in the first hundred years is 282, so we can set up the equation:\n   282 = x + 2x + 4x + ... + 2^n*x\n8. This equation represents a geometric series with the first term x and the common ratio 2.\n9. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can express the sum as:\n   282 = x * (1 - 2^(n+1)) / (1 - 2)\n10.

Therefore, Samantha's last name has 6 - 3 = 3 letters.\n\nAnswer: 3.", "Step 1: Let's assume Samantha's last name has \"x\" number of letters.\nStep 2: Therefore, Bobbie's last name has \"x + 3\" number of letters.\nStep 3: If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie's, which means Bobbie's last name would have 2 * 4 = 8 letters.\nStep 4: So, \"x + 3 - 2 = 8\".\nStep 5: Simplifying the equation, we have \"x + 1 = 8\".\nStep 6: Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get \"x = 7\".\nStep 7: Therefore, Samantha's last name has 7 letters. \n\nAnswer: 7", "Step 1: Let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name.\n2. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie's.\n3. Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey.\n\nStep 2: Let's assume the length of Bobbie's last name is \"x\" letters.\n\nStep 3: According to the first information, Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name. So, Samantha's last name has a length of \"x - 3\" letters.\n\nStep 4: According to the second information, if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie's. Jamie's last name is \"Grey\" which has a length of 4 letters. So, Bobbie's last name after removing two letters is 2 * 4 = 8 letters.\n\nStep 5: From step 4, we know Bobbie's last name after removing two letters is 8 letters. So, we can set up the equation \"x - 2 = 8\" to find the length of Bobbie's original last name.\n\nStep 6: Solving the equation from step 5, we find that x = 10. So, Bobbie's original last name has a length of 10 letters.\n\nStep 7: From step 3, we know Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name. Since Bobbie's last name has 10 letters, Samantha's last name has a length of 10 - 3 = 7 letters.\n\nAnswer: 7", "First, let's determine the length of Jamie's last name. We are told that Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey, so her last name is \"Grey\". The length of the last name is 4 letters.\n\nNext, let's determine the length of Bobbie's last name. We are told that Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name. Since Bobbie's last name is longer, let's assume it has the length x. Therefore, Samantha's last name has the length x - 3.\n\nIf Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie's. This means Bobbie's new last name would have a length of 2 * 4 = 8 letters.\n\nTo find the length of Bobbie's original last name, we add the two letters she took off to the length of her new last name: x - 2 = 8. Solving this equation, we find that x = 10.\n\nFinally, let's find the length of Samantha's last name. Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name, so it has a length of 10 - 3 = 7 letters.\n\nAnswer: 7", "1. Let's assume that Samantha's last name has x letters.\n2. According to the given information, Bobbie's last name has x + 3 letters.\n3. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie's, which is 9 letters.\n4. So, x + 3 - 2 = 2 * 9.\n5. Simplifying this equation, we get x + 1 = 18.\n6. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we have x = 17.\n7. Therefore, Samantha's last name has 17 letters.\n\nAnswer: 17", "1. Let's set up some variables:\n- Samantha's last name length: S\n- Bobbie's last name length: B\n\n2. \"Samantha\u2019s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie\u2019s last name.\"\nThis means S = B - 3.\n\n3. \"If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s.\"\nIf Bobbie's last name length is B - 2, then it is twice the length of Jamie's last name, which is 4 (Jamie Grey). So, B - 2 = 2 * 4.\n\n4. Simplifying the equation from step 3: B - 2 = 8.\n\n5. Solving for B: B = 8 + 2 = 10.\n\n6. Using the value of B from step 5, we can find S:\nS = B - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.\n\nAnswer: 7."]}
