However, it is important to note that not all cases of rabies in humans will result in death.

Additionally, it leads to death. It is also mentioned that the early symptoms of rabies are nonspecific and can include fever, headache, and general malaise.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that if left untreated, rabies can progress to encephalopathy and eventually death.

However, it is important to note that not all cases of rabies in humans will result in death. Timely medical intervention, such as post-exposure prophylaxis, can significantly increase the chances of survival. Therefore, while rabies has a high fatality rate, it is not always fatal with appropriate medical care.\n\nAnswer: Yes", "1. The premise states that the rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death.\n2.

However, we cannot conclude with certainty that all cases of rabies in humans will be fatal. \n\nThere have been rare cases where individuals have survived rabies, although these cases are extremely rare. Rabies is considered one of the most lethal diseases, and if left untreated, it is almost always fatal.

Additionally, it leads to death. It is also mentioned that the early symptoms of rabies are nonspecific and can include fever, headache, and general malaise.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that if left untreated, rabies can progress to encephalopathy and eventually death.

The hypothesis states that humans existed 10,000 years ago.\n\nGiven the information provided in the premise, we can conclude that early humans did, in fact, exist roughly 10,000 years ago. Therefore, the hypothesis \"Humans existed 10,000 years ago\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes", "Step 1: The premise states that early humans developed agriculture roughly 10,000 years ago.\nStep 2: The premise also states that the development of agriculture by early humans was harmful to many natural ecosystems.\nStep 3: The premise does not directly mention the existence of humans 10,000 years ago, it only refers to their activities.\n\nBased on the provided premise, we cannot directly conclude whether the hypothesis \"Humans existed 10,000 years ago.\" is true or false. The premise does not provide explicit information about the existence of humans at that time. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be confirmed or refuted based on the given premise.\n\nAnswer: No", "Step 1: The development of agriculture by early humans occurred roughly 10,000 years ago. (Given premise)\n\nStep 2: If the development of agriculture occurred roughly 10,000 years ago, then humans must have existed at that time. (Implication)\n\nStep 3: Humans existed 10,000 years ago. (From Step 2)\n\nAnswer: Yes", "Step 1: The premise states that the development of agriculture by early humans occurred 10,000 years ago.\nStep 2: The premise also states that the development of agriculture was harmful to natural ecosystems.\nStep 3: The hypothesis states that humans existed 10,000 years ago.\n\nBased on the given premise, we can conclude that humans existed 10,000 years ago. Despite the potential harm caused by agriculture, the premise implies the presence of early humans engaging in agricultural practices. Therefore, the hypothesis \"Humans existed 10,000 years ago.\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes", "1. The premise states that the development of agriculture by early humans occurred roughly 10,000 years ago.\n2. If the development of agriculture by early humans occurred roughly 10,000 years ago, it implies that humans existed at that time.\n3. The hypothesis \"Humans existed 10,000 years ago\" aligns with the premise, as it directly relates to the existence of humans during the period mentioned.\n4. Therefore, based on the given premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis \"Humans existed 10,000 years ago\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes", "1. The premise states that the development of agriculture by early humans occurred roughly 10,000 years ago.\n\n2. If the development of agriculture by early humans occurred roughly 10,000 years ago, it implies that the existence of humans goes back at least 10,000 years.\n\n3. Therefore, based on the premise, we can conclude that humans existed 10,000 years ago.\n\nAnswer: Yes", "1. The premise states that early humans developed agriculture roughly 10,000 years ago.\n2. The development of agriculture by early humans is a clear indication that humans existed at that time.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that humans existed 10,000 years ago.\n\nAnswer: Yes", "1. The premise states that early humans developed agriculture roughly 10,000 years ago.\n2. The development of agriculture by early humans was harmful to many natural ecosystems.\n3. However, the premise does not provide direct evidence or mention the existence of humans 10,000 years ago.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premise alone, we cannot conclude whether the hypothesis \"Humans existed 10,000 years ago\" is true or not. The premise only discusses the development of agriculture and its impact on natural ecosystems, but it does not provide direct information about the existence of humans at that specific time.\n\nAnswer: No", "1. The premise states that agriculture was developed by early humans roughly 10,000 years ago. This implies that humans existed 10,000 years ago.\n\n2. The premise does not directly provide evidence for the hypothesis that humans existed 10,000 years ago. It only states that agriculture was developed by early humans around that time.\n\n3. The premise does not provide any information about the overall timeline of human existence. It only focuses on a specific aspect of human activity.\n\n4. Therefore, based solely on the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \"Humans existed 10,000 years ago\" is true.\n\nAnswer: No", "First, the premise states that early humans developed agriculture roughly 10,000 years ago. This implies that humans did exist 10,000 years ago. However, the premise does not specifically mention the existence of humans 10,000 years ago, only that they were responsible for the development of agriculture at that time.\n\nTherefore, based solely on this premise, we can infer that humans did exist 10,000 years ago.
