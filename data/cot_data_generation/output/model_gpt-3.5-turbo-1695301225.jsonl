Let the original number of females be 1x and the original number of males be 2x, based on the initial ratio of 1:2.\n\nAccording to the information given:\n\nThe ratio of females to males was 1:2 initially, so we have: Females (F) = 1x Males (M) = 2x\nAfter 7 females and 7 males left, the ratio became 1:3, so we have: (F - 7) / (M - 7) = 1/3\nNow, let's set up this equation and solve for x:\n(F - 7) / (M - 7) = 1/3\nSubstitute the values of F and M from the initial ratios:\n(1x - 7) / (2x - 7) = 1/3\nNow, cross-multiply:\n3(1x - 7) = 1(2x - 7)\n3x - 21 = 2x - 7\nNow, isolate x by subtracting 2x from both sides and adding 21 to both sides:\n3x - 2x = -7 + 21\nx = 14\nSo, x represents the number of females originally, which is 14. The number of males originally is 2x, which is 2 * 14 = 28.\nTo find the total number of people at the party originally, add the number of females and males:\nTotal = Number of Females + Number of Males Total = 14 + 28 Total = 42\nThere were originally 42 people at the party.", "solution": "Step 1: Let x be number of females.
