Genghis Khan was the founder of the Mongol Empire and lived in the 12th and 13th centuries. Julius Caesar was a Roman general and statesman who lived in the 1st century BC.\n\nNext, we need to think about population growth rates and the duration of each empire. The Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan lasted for around 80 years, while the Roman Empire during Julius Caesar's time spanned several centuries.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is more likely that more people today are related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar.
