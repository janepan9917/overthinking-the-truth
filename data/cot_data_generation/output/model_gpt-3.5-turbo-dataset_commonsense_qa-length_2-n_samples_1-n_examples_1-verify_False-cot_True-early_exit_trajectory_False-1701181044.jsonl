This indicates that the sanctions had a negative impact on the school and were intended to be severe or detrimental.\n\nFinally, we are told that the sanctions seemed to \"what the efforts the school had made to change?\" This suggests that the sanctions had undermined or diminished the school's efforts to make changes or improve.\n\nBased on this analysis, the word that best completes the sentence is \"ignore.\" This is because if the sanctions were a punishing blow, it means they had a significant impact. If the efforts of the school to change were \"ignored,\" it means that the sanctions disregarded or invalidated those efforts. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\nAnswer: A"]}
