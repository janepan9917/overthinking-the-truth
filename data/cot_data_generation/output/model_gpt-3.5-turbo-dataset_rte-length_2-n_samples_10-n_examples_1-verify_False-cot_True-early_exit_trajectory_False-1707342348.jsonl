The premise states that the main institutionalized forms of recognition in various fields are the Nobel prizes. This means that for each of the mentioned fields (physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economics), the Nobel Prize is the main recognition. \n\nHowever, the premise does not state anything specifically about whether Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen. It only establishes that the Nobel prizes serve as recognition for significant contributions in different fields. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen based solely on this premise.\n\nAnswer: No", "1. The premise states that the Nobel prizes are the main institutionalized forms of recognition in several fields, including peace.\n2. The premise does not explicitly state that Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen, only that the Nobel prizes exist.\n3. The existence of the Nobel prizes does not necessarily imply that candidates have been chosen for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n4. It is possible that candidates have been chosen for other Nobel prizes in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and economics, but not for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n5. Therefore, based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \"Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen\" is true.\n\nAnswer: No", "1. The premise states that the Nobel prizes are the main institutionalized forms of recognition in various fields, including peace.\n2. The Nobel Peace Prize is specifically mentioned as one of the main institutionalized forms of recognition.\n3. The premise does not provide any information about whether or not Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen.\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude the hypothesis \"Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen\" based solely on the given premise.\n\nAnswer: No", "1. The Nobel prizes are awarded for significant contributions in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economics. \n2. The main institutionalized forms of recognition for these contributions are the Nobel prizes. \n3. The Nobel Peace Prize is included in this list. \n\nBased on these points, we can conclude that candidates have indeed been chosen for the Nobel Peace Prize. \n\nAnswer: Yes", "To evaluate the hypothesis \"Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen,\" we need to analyze the information provided in the premise. The premise states that the Nobel prizes are the main institutionalized forms of recognition for various fields, including those working for peace.\n\nHowever, the premise does not explicitly mention whether Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen or not. It only states that the Nobel prizes exist as forms of recognition. Additionally, given that the phrase \"and more recently in the area of economics\" is included, it implies that the list of recognized fields may not be exhaustive.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the premise, we cannot conclude that Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen. The premise provides information about the existence of Nobel prizes but does not provide evidence about the current or past selection of specific candidates.\n\nAnswer: No", "1. The Nobel prizes are the main institutionalized forms of recognition for those who have made significant contributions in various fields.\n2. The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the Nobel prizes.\n3. The Nobel Peace Prize is specifically awarded to individuals or organizations that have made significant contributions towards promoting peace.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen. \nAnswer: Yes", "Step 1: The premise states that the Nobel prizes are the main institutionalized forms of recognition for those working for peace.\n\nStep 2: The Nobel Peace Prize is a specific category among the Nobel prizes.\n\nStep 3: The fact that the Nobel prizes exist and are the main forms of recognition for peace suggests that candidates have been chosen for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the hypothesis \"Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen\" is most likely true.\n\nAnswer: Yes"]}
