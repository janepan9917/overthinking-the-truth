	No	Final CoT Answer


Premise:
Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.
Based on this premise, can we conclude the hypothesis "Rabies is fatal in humans." is true?
Your answer should be Yes or No, and should appear at the end of your response after "Answer:". For instance, if your answer is Yes, end your response with "Answer: Yes".

 Let's think step-by-step.	Yes	Direct Prompting Answer
Step 1: Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death.	Yes	Early Exit Answer 0
This statement indicates that the virus leads to encephalopathy, which is a condition characterized by damage to the brain. The statement also mentions that this ultimately leads to death. Based on this information, we can conclude that rabies infection is potentially life-threatening.	Yes	Early Exit Answer 1
 	Yes	Early Exit Answer 2
Step 2: Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.	Yes	Early Exit Answer 3
This statement mentions the early symptoms of rabies infection in humans, which are nonspecific and include fever, headache, and general malaise. These symptoms do not directly indicate that the infection is fatal, but they do highlight the presence of an illness.	Yes	Early Exit Answer 4
	Yes	Early Exit Answer 5
Combining both steps, we can infer that rabies infection can lead to a condition that damages the brain and ultimately leads to death. However, it is important to note that not all individuals infected with rabies will necessarily die. Some individuals may receive appropriate medical treatment, such as the rabies vaccine, which can prevent the virus from progressing to a life-threatening stage.	Yes	Early Exit Answer 6

 Let's think step-by-step.	Yes	Direct Prompting Answer
First, the premise states that early humans developed agriculture roughly 10,000 years ago. This implies that humans did exist 10,000 years ago. However, the premise does not specifically mention the existence of humans 10,000 years ago, only that they were responsible for the development of agriculture at that time.	Yes	Early Exit Answer 0
	Yes	Early Exit Answer 1
Therefore, based solely on this premise, we can infer that humans did exist 10,000 years ago. However, this inference is not a conclusive proof of their existence, as the premise only indirectly implies it. 	Yes	Early Exit Answer 2
