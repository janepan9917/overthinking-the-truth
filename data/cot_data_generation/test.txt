question
-17 + 18x + -7 + 13x + -1x = 246

____________________

gt_solution
1. First Step : Identify the free numbers and the expressions with x in each side
-17 +18x -7 +13x -x  = 246 
2. Second step: Sum the matching groups in each side ( if it's possible )
30.0x -24.0 = 0x 246.0
3. Third Step: Move all the variables to the right, and the free numbers to the left 
30.0x = 270.0
4. Final step: divide both sides by the coefficient of the right side 
x = 9.0
