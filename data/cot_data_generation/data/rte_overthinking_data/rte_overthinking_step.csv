The two winning bids will be chosen on December 2010 by the 24-man executive committee of FIFA.  Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter: "We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature."\nBased on this premise, can we conclude the hypothesis "Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA." is true?\nYour answer should be Yes or No, and should appear at the end of your response after "Answer:". For instance, if your answer is Yes, end your response with "Answer: Yes".\n\n Let's think step-by-step.\nStep 1: Identify the statement related to the hypothesis.\nThe statement related to the hypothesis is "Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter: 'We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition...'" This statement implies that Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA.\n\nStep 2: Assess the credibility of the source.\nThe source of the statement is not directly mentioned. It is unclear if the statement is attributed to Sepp Blatter himself or if it is a reported statement from a reliable source. Additionally, the premise does not provide any additional information about the role or authority of Sepp Blatter.\nAnswer: "|Yes
"Premise:\nRabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.\nBased on this premise, can we conclude the hypothesis "Rabies is fatal in humans." is true?\nYour answer should be Yes or No, and should appear at the end of your response after "Answer:". For instance, if your answer is Yes, end your response with "Answer: Yes".\n\n Let's think step-by-step.\nStep 1: Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death.\nThis means that rabies affects the brain and can lead to encephalopathy, which is a general term for brain dysfunction. Additionally, it ultimately leads to death.\n\nStep 2: Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.\nNonspecific symptoms are those that can be indicative of various illnesses and are not unique to a specific condition.\n\nStep 3: Putting it together.\nFrom the provided premise, we know that rabies affects the central nervous system and causes encephalopathy. We also know that early symptoms are nonspecific, including fever, headache, and general malaise. However, the premise does not explicitly state that all individuals infected with rabies will die. It only suggests that the virus can lead to death if left untreated or unvaccinated. \nAnswer: "|Yes

Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the hypothesis "Rabies is fatal in humans" is true.\nAnswer: "|Yes

For instance, if your answer is Yes, end your response with "Answer: Yes".\n\n Let's think step-by-step.\n1. The premise states that the rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death.\n2. It also mentions that early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.\n\nBased on this information, we can make some logical deductions:\n\n1. Rabies infects the central nervous system.\n2. Rabies causes encephalopathy (a brain disease or disorder).\n3. Rabies ultimately leads to death.\n4. Early symptoms of rabies are nonspecific and can be mistaken for other illnesses.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all individuals infected with rabies will ultimately die. There have been rare cases of survival with early treatment. Therefore, while rabies is generally fatal in humans, there are exceptional cases where survival is possible.\nAnswer: "|Yes

"Premise:\nThe development of agriculture by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, was also harmful to many natural ecosystems as they were systematically destroyed and replaced with artificial versions.\nBased on this premise, can we conclude the hypothesis "Humans existed 10,000 years ago." is true?\nYour answer should be Yes or No, and should appear at the end of your response after "Answer:". For instance, if your answer is Yes, end your response with "Answer: Yes".\n\n Let's think step-by-step.\nStep 1: The premise states that early humans developed agriculture roughly 10,000 years ago.\nStep 2: The premise also states that the development of agriculture by early humans was harmful to many natural ecosystems.\nStep 3: The premise does not directly mention the existence of humans 10,000 years ago, it only refers to their activities.\nAnswer: "|Yes
