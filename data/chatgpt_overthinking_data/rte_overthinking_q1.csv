Zerhouni said at a news conference that the voter turnout was "exceptional", but insisted that the figures had not been manipulated, saying that anyone with evidence of fraud should take it to election officials.  Bouteflika's critics assert that the victory was a foregone conclusion — his opponents were not well known, and his campaign was well-funded.
