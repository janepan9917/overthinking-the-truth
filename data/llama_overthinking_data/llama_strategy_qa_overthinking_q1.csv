"Question:\nWould a modern central processing unit circuit chip fit on a housekey?\nYour answer should be Yes or No, and should appear at the end of your response after "Answer:". For instance, if your answer is Yes, end your response with "Answer: Yes".\n\n Let's think step-by-step.\n\n  First, let's define what a housekey is.  A housekey is a small, flat piece of metal that is used to unlock a door to a house.  Let's assume that the housekey is approximately 2 inches long and 1 inch wide.\nNext, let's think about the size of a modern central processing unit circuit chip.  These chips are typically very small, but they can vary in size depending on their complexity and the manufacturing process used to create them.  For the purposes of this thought experiment, let's assume that the central processing unit circuit chip is approximately 1/4 inch long and 1/4 inch wide.\nNow, let's consider whether or not a modern central processing unit circuit chip could fit on a housekey.  To do this, we need to compare the size of the chip to the size of the housekey.
