The third word is "just". This word indicates that she prefers the thing she's about to mention over the thing she's currently doing. The fourth word is "spray". This is a verb, so it tells us the action she's taking. The fifth word is "herself". This word is a reflexive pronoun, so it indicates that the action of spraying is being done to her own body. The sixth word is "with". This word indicates that she's spraying something with the water. The seventh word is "water". This word tells us what she's spraying herself with."|A
