"Premise:\nPresident Obama found a new way to answer to the questions that people have to ask him. So he held a "virtual townhall" in which people could write in questions and he would answer them online. He was asked many questions, and one of the most important was about the legalization of marijuana. Obama was very discreet about it. We will give you the full question : "With over 1 out of 30 Americans controlled by the penal system, why not legalize, control, and tax marijuana to change the failed war on drugs into a money making, money saving boost to the economy? Do we really need that many victimless criminals?" The president's answer was a strategical one. He started by quoting the question he was asked which was whether legalizing marijuana would improve the economy and job creation. And he answered : "The answer is no, I don't think that's a good strategy to grow our economy. All right.".\nBased on this premise, can we conclude the hypothesis "President Obama is in favour of the legalization of marijuana." is true?\nYour answer should be Yes or No. First, explain your answer, and end your response with "Answer:".\n\n Let's think step-by-step.\n\n"|No
